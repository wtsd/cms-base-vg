# Basic repository for the web-site core

## Synopsis

For whom it may concern: for researchers and web-developers, students and risky guys. I was making pet-projects for years using the same codebase, modifying structures and implementing easy-to-deploy and maintain framework. If you are interested in implementing it in your projects, be my guest!

## INSTALLATION

You need to clone the repository to your project_dir. The host adding script is made for a standard Ubuntu + Apache2 configuration. It creates a virtual host, a record in `/etc/hosts` and database is added by a default `root` user without a password. In case you need other credentials, use the arguments.

    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:vgafurov/cms-base.git project_dir

    $ cd project_dir

    $ sudo php scripts/add-host.php hostname.dev

    $ php scripts/add-database.php db_name [db_user db_pass]

    $ cd dist

If composer is not install:
    
    $ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

    $ php composer.phar install

In case, there is no bower or nodejs on your system, install them. For Ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt-get install nodejs npm

    $ npm install -g bower                         

Then you need to install front-end dependencies:

    $ bower install

    $ cp app/config/config-dist.yml app/config/config.yml

Do the configuration, using your fav editor.

    $ cp app/config/database-dist.yml app/config/database-dev.yml

    $ cp app/config/database-dist.yml app/config/database-prod.yml

Install Grunt:

    $ npm install grunt --save-dev

Use Grunt:

    $ grunt

While developing, better use:

    $ grunt watch

Use of SASS:

    $ sass --watch path/to/file.scss:output/path/file.css

The same here. Do the configuration.
